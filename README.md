# Operationalizing Machine Learning - Pipeline Automation
In this project we are deploying two machine learning models.One using Azure UI and second using Jupyter notebook in SDK. This project uses Bank Marketing Dataset. The link for the dataset is https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv .By both the methods I tried to get the best model required.

## Key Steps
As shown in Architectural Diagram, I had implemented those steps.The screenshots of those are attached herewith.

First I explored the dataset.

Then I created and the dataset from local files.

After that I trained the AutoML model.In this AutoML trained model using several models and found their respective accuracies.Here, I had run the experiment using Classification Technique.
